# Awesomizer

A Xamarin.iOS library full of awesomeness (animations and useful helpers)

Awesomizer provides a set of **useful** extensions to `UIView`, such as  
a set of animations, and various size, position and image effects.

It is designed to be **as easy to use as possible to integrate and use** to 
speed up everyday development tasks. All the methods are well documented 
and described.
